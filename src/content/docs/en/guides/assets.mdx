**Built-in optimized asset support** is enabled in Astro behind an experimental flag. This built-in feature will eventually replace the optional `@astrojs/image` integration.

The new assets experience currently features:

- A new built-in `<Image />` component
- Relative images with automatic optimization in Markdown, [MDX](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/), and [Markdoc](/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/)
- Integration with content collections
- Improved error messages and types

:::caution
Assets are an experimental Astro feature introduced in v2.1. This API is subject to change before it is marked as stable.
:::

## Enabling Assets in your Project

Enabling assets may cause some breaking changes in your project. It may also require some manual changes to take advantage of new features.

Please check every section below to avoid errors and to get the most out of using the experimental assets option!

### Update Config

To enable built-in asset support, add the following lines to your `astro.config.mjs` configuration file:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-6}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
   assets: true
  }
});
```

When you next run Astro, it will update your `src/env.d.ts` file to configure types for you. To do this manually, replace the `astro/client` reference with `astro/client-image`:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts" del={1} ins={2}
/// <reference types="astro/client" />
/// <reference types="astro/client-image" />
```

### Move your images to `src/assets/`

Create `src/assets/`, which Astro will recognize as your new assets folder.

We recommend storing all images to be optimized in the `src/assets/` directory to make use of our official `~/assets` alias, although this location is optional. If you don't know where to put your images, or if you're building a product around Astro (e.g. a CMS), you can put your images there and we promise we won't break them! But, images can be stored anywhere, including alongside your content, if you prefer.

Your images can be used by components (`.astro`, `.mdx`, and other UI frameworks) and in Markdown files.

### Update existing `<img>` tags

Previously, importing an image would return a simple `string` with the path of the image. With the new `image` features enabled, imported image assets now match the following signature:

```ts
interface ImageMetadata {
  src: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  format: string;
}
```

You must update the `src` attribute of any existing `<img>` tags, and you may also update other attributes that are now available to you from the imported image.

```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" ".src" ".width" ".height" del={2,5} ins={3,6}
---
import rocket from '../images/rocket.svg';
import rocket from '../assets/images/rocket.svg'
---
<img src={rocket} width="250" height="250" alt="A rocketship in space." />
<img src={rocket.src} width={rocket.width} height={rocket.height} alt="A rocketship in space." />
```

### Update your Markdown, MDX, and Markdoc files

Relative images can now be referenced in Markdown, MDX, and Markdoc files. These will automatically be optimized and hashed by Astro's build process.

This allows you to move your images from the `public/` directory to the new, reserved `src/assets/` directory or move them near your Markdown, MDX, or Markdoc files. (See the URL path of these built images in the example below.)

Your existing images in `public/` and remote images are still valid but are not automatically optimized by Astro's build process.

```md title="src/pages/posts/post-1.md" "/_astro" ".hash" "../../assets/"
# My Markdown Page

<!-- Local image stored at src/assets/stars.png -->
![A starry night sky.](../../assets/stars.png)
<img src="/_astro/stars.hash.png" alt="A starry night sky.">

<!-- Image stored at public/images/stars.png -->
![A starry night sky.](/images/stars.png)
<img src="/images/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky.">

<!-- Remote image on another server -->
![Astro logo](https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png)
<img src="https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png" width="25" alt="Astro logo">
```

### Convert from `@astrojs/image`

**Built-in asset support is incompatible with the `@astrojs/image` integration.**

:::note[cropping images]
The Assets API does not support image cropping. The current behaviour is to resize images to fit.

Use the `@astrojs/image` integration if you need support for cropping images. Alternatively, you can use the [`object-fit` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) to achieve a similar result. 
:::

To avoid errors in your project, complete the following steps:

1. Remove the `@astrojs/image` integration.

    You must [remove the integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/#removing-an-integration) by uninstalling and then removing it from your `astro.config.mjs` file.

2. Migrate any existing `<Image />` components.

    Change all `import` statements from `@astrojs/image/components` to `astro:assets` to use the new built-in `<Image />` component.

    Remove any component attributes that are not [currently supported image asset properties](#properties).

    For example `aspectRatio` is no longer supported, as it is now automatically inferred from the `width` and `height` attributes.

      ```astro title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" del= {2,11} ins={3}
      ---
      import { Image } from '@astrojs/image/components';
      import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
      import localImage from "../assets/logo.png";
      const localAlt = "The Astro Logo";
      ---

      <Image
        src={localImage}
        width={300}
        aspectRatio="16:9"
        alt={localAlt}
      />
      ```


3. Remove any existing `<Picture />` components

    Currently, the built-in assets feature does not include a `<Picture />` component.

    Instead, you can use the HTML image attributes `srcset` and `sizes` or the `<picture>` tag [for art direction or to create responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#art_direction).


### Update content collections schemas

You can now declare images in your frontmatter as their paths relative to the current folder.

```md title="src/content/blog/my-post.md"
---
title: "My first blog post"
cover: "./firstpostcover.jpeg" # will resolve to "src/content/blog/firstblogcover.jpeg"
coverAlt: "A photograph of a sunset behind a mountain range"
---

This is a blog post
```

A new `image` helper for content collections lets you validate the image metadata using Zod.

```ts title="src/content/config.ts"
import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
	schema: ({ image }) => z.object({
		title: z.string(),
		cover: image().refine((img) => img.width >= 1080, {
			message: "Cover image must be at least 1080 pixels wide!",
		}),
		coverAlt: z.string(),
	}),
});

export const collections = {
	blog: blogCollection,
};
```

The image will be imported and transformed into metadata that matches the signature of imported images, allowing you to pass it as a `src` to `<Image/>` or `getImage()`. A blog index page might render the cover photo and title of each blog post:

```astro title="src/pages/blog.astro" {10}
---
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
const allBlogPosts = await getCollection("blog");
---

{
	allBlogPosts.map((post) => (
		<div>
			<Image src={post.data.cover} alt={post.data.coverAlt} />
			<h2>
				<a href={"/blog/" + post.slug}>{post.data.title}</a>
			</h2>
		</div>
	))
}
```

## `astro:assets` module

Enabling asset support allows you to access the `astro:assets` module. This module exposes the following features:

- `<Image />` (available in `.astro` and `.mdx` files)
- `getImage()` (available in `.astro`, `.mdx`, `.ts`, `.js` on the server)

:::caution
`<Image />` is an Astro component and [can't be used in framework components](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#can-i-use-astro-components-inside-my-framework-components).

`getImage()` relies on server-only APIs and breaks the build when used on the client.
:::

### `<Image />` (`astro:assets`)

The `<Image />` component generates an `<img>` tag.

This component can transform an image's dimensions, file type, and quality to produce an optimized image. The resulting `<img>` tag will include the correct `width` and `height` attributes to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift **(CLS)**.

:::tip[What is Cumulative Layout Shift?]
CLS is a score that reflects how much content shifted on your page during loading. The ideal number for CLS is as close to zero as possible, which the `Image` component enforces by automatically selecting the correct `width` and `height` for local images.
:::

Import images from a **relative file path** or [import alias](/en/guides/aliases/) in any component file and then use the import as the `<Image />` component's `src` attribute.

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="A description of my image." />
```

```astro
<!-- Output -->
<!-- Image is optimized, proper attributes are enforced -->
<img
  src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="A description of my image."
/>
```

#### Properties

##### width and height

These properties define the dimensions to use for the image.

When using local images in their original aspect ratio, the `width` and `height` can be automatically inferred from the source file and are optional. However, both of these properties are required for remote images.

##### format

You can optionally state the [image file type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#common_image_file_types) to be used. The default file format used is `webp`.

##### quality

`quality` is an optional property that can either be:
- a preset (`low`, `mid`, `high`, `max`) that is automatically normalized between formats.
- a number from `0` to `100` (interpreted differently between formats).

##### alt (required)

Use the `alt` attribute to provide [descriptive alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for images.

This attribute is required for the `<Image />` component. This component will throw an error if no alt text is provided.

If the image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn't contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers know to ignore the image.

##### Additional properties

In addition to the properties above, the `<Image />` component accepts all properties accepted by the HTML `<img>` tag.

For example, you can provide a `class` to the final `img` element.

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png";
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="" class="my-class" />
```

```astro
<!-- Output -->
<img
  src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  class="my-class"
  alt=""
/>
```

### `getImage()` (`astro:assets`)

This function is intended for generating images destined to be used somewhere else than directly in HTML, for example in an [API Route](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes). It also allows you to create your own custom `<Image />` component.

`getImage()` takes an options object with the same properties as the Image component (except `alt`).

```astro
---
import { getImage } from "astro:assets";
import myBackground from "../background.png"

const optimizedBackground = await getImage({src: myBackground, format: 'avif'})
---

<div style={`background-image: url(${optimizedBackground.src});`}></div>
```

It returns an object with the following properties:

```js
{
  options: {...} // Original parameters passed,
  src: "https//..." // Path to the generated image,
  attributes: {...} // Additional HTML attributes needed to render the image (width, height, style, etc..)
}
```

## Using sharp

By default, Astro uses [Squoosh](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh) to transform your images.

If you're building a static site or deploying an SSR site to a Node environment, we recommend using [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp), which offers faster performance but requires Node. To use sharp, first install it:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install sharp
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm install sharp
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add sharp
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Then, enable Astro's sharp image service in your config:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig, sharpImageService } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
	experimental: {
		assets: true,
	},
	image: {
		service: sharpImageService(),
	},
});
```
